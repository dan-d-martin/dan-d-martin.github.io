  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am a developer of web-based applications based in Leeds.</p>
  <p>Since 2011 I have been working for the rapidly expanding search marketing agency [Epiphany Search](http://www.epiphanysearch.co.uk) as the Head of Internal Projects. This is a very interesting role that involves building web-based tools for use within the business and in the past 3 years my team and I have built a suite of around a dozen applications; some large, some small and all built on a common platform and able to interact with one another.</p>
  <p>Prior to that I have worked as a web developer for several web agencies and for an organisational development consultancy.</p>
  <p>My main technology interests are PHP (primarily with Symfony 2) and Javascript (for front and back end) but I have experience with a wide range of technologies and systems.</p>
